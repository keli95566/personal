I am a second-year Ph.D. fellow at the [Helmholz Graduate School for Structured of Matter (DASHH)](https://www.dashh.org/) supervised by Prof.Frank Steinicke, Dr. Reinhard Bacher, and Prof.Wim Leemans. 

In my Ph.D., I work interdisciplinary between the particle accelerator control system group at the [German Electron Synchrotron (DESY)](https://www.desy.de/) and the [Human Computer Interaction group](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/hci/people.html) at the Hamburg University. I am developing mixed reality technology for operating large-scale physics facilities such as particle accelerators and high-power lasers.


Before joining DASHH, I graduated from the Master of Photonics program at the Abbe School of Photonics, where I had extensive training in applied and theoretical optics. During my master's study, I also worked as a research assistant at the **German Aerospace Center (DLR)**, and the **Fraunhofer Institute of Precision Engineering and Applied Optics**.
