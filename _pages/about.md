I am a **mixed reality researcher** with a strong technical background and research interests in:

- üïπÔ∏è Mixed reality technology  
- ü•Ω Immersive head mounted display
- üñ•Ô∏è [Immersive radiance field rendering](https://github.com/uhhhci/immersive-ngp) (e.g., NeRF, 3DGS)  
- üëæ Embodied intelligent virtual agents
- ü§ñ Human‚Äìrobot interaction

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher on the European Union‚Äìfunded project [PRESENCE](https://presence-xr.eu/), where I serve on the technical committee and lead the development of **intelligent virtual human technologies**. My work focuses in particular on enabling multimodal interaction with virtual agents in immersive environments.

I completed my Ph.D. as a fellow of the [**Helmholtz Graduate School for the Structure of Matter (DASHH)**](https://www.dashh.org/), under the supervision of [Prof. Frank Steinicke](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=bmRsMpUAAAAJ&hl=en), Dr. Reinhard Bacher, and [Prof. Wim Leemans](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_aSYAMEAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research was conducted at the intersection of: The Particle Accelerator Control Systems Group at the [**German Electron Synchrotron (DESY)**](https://www.desy.de/) and the [**Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction Group**](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/hci/people.html) at the University of Hamburg

During my PhD, I developed novel mixed reality technologies for operating large-scale physics infrastructures, including building video see-through head mounted displays, developing immersive neural rendering/radiance field rendering techniques, building a mobile robot and it's immersive teleoperation system.

Before joining DASHH, I earned my M.Sc. in Photonics from the **Abbe School of Photonics**, where I received extensive training in both theoretical and applied optics. During this time, I worked as a research assistant at the*German Aerospace Center (DLR) ‚Äì Institute of Data Science and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering.

üíº I am actively exploring opportunities for roles such as **Research Scientist**, **Research Engineer**, or **Mixed/Virtual Reality Developer**‚Äîin both **academic** and **industry** settings.

üí° I'm always open to **collaborations**, expanding my **network**, and contributing to exciting projects in **mixed reality**, **visual computing**, **computer graphics**, and **AI research**.
